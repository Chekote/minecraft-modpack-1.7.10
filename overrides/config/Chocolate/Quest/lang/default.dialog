@prompt:Tell me about Tritons
Tritons have dominated the oceans even before creatures appeared on the surface,
they are witty and shy creatures, and it's rare to see them around the surface.
The first time they were seen was during the "Fire wars", they tried to calm goblins 
but could do nothing, it is rumoured that some of them established around lakes and 
rivers but there is no proof. The second time they were seen on the surface was during 
the "Abyss Walkers" invasion, they had a great knowledge of magic and provided a great 
support to the other races on the surface, but after the invasion ended they reclaimed 
some territories which started some conflicts. These days Tritons live in their ocean 
cities under the menace of pirates.

@name:loreOrc
@prompt:Tell me about Orcs
Goblins and Dwarves were the first known species that inhabited the surface, 
but one day goblins went crazy and started fires all around. 
That caused conflicts with dwarves and started the "Fire wars", until orcs 
appeared to calm them. Time after the "Fire wars" ended some creatures on the 
surface started mutating to oversized creatures. 
Many orcs and goblins had their houses destroyed by those creatures and 
they adapted to a new lifestyle. Now Orcs and Goblins are nomads, experts on 
monsters hunting.

@name:loreDwarves
@prompt:Tell me about dwarves
Dwarves used to live on forests, they were expert engineers and created great 
constructions, the most notable one was the impregnable fortress, an immense 
fortress in the sky sustained by a single pillar, created with an ancient stone 
hard but lightweight, no one knows where they extracted it. 
Dwarves established their homes on mountains and caves during the "Fire wars", 
hiding from goblins attack, during years the only place on the surface where 
dwarves could be seen was in the impregnable fortress and still today it's a 
mystery how they kept it supplied. In the caves they discovered minerals and 
gunpowder and they researched the technology to craft golems and fire weapons. 
These days dwarves have immense empires hidden underground and are dedicated to 
trades and sometimes they send golems to protect human villages.
